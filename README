Set-up
======

The *Nova PM sensor* is represented at /dev/ttyUSB0 with owner root and group
dialout. To avoid having to run this program as root in order to access the
sensor, add your user to the dialout group. You may need to reboot for changes
to take effect [1].

```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
